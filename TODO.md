# To-do list

## Path to v1.0.0

* Finish porting example scripts to more Elixir-like syntax.
* Check all code samples in module docs to ensure they're up-to-date.
* Release v1.0.0!

## Update to kRPC 0.4.4

I've got a branch for this, and I've got all the new functions mocked out.
However, I can't actually proceed until I understand how to use the new
functions, so I can create meaningful syntax and test examples for them.
There's nearly zero documentation at the moment â€” the API docs alone aren't
very helpful without any sort of example usage, since everything is just an
Expression.
